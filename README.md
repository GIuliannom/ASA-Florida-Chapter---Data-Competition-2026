## ASA South Florida 2026 Student Data Challenge
Graduate Prediction Track Submission
This repository contains my submission for the 2026 ASA South Florida Student Data Challenge. The goal of this challenge is to predict HDL cholesterol levels (LBDHDD_outcome) using demographic, dietary, and anthropometric data from the 2024 NHANES survey.

## Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Used a more data science approach and selected the variables based on the correlation to the variables of interest.

Model Selection: * Baseline: Linear Regression.

Advanced: Exploring XGBoost and Bayesian Regression to optimize RMSE.

Validation: Utilizing 5-fold cross-validation on the training set (1,000 observations) to tune hyperparameters.


## Results Summary
Validation for XGBoost RMSE: 4.72 \n
Validation for Bayesian Regression: 5.63 \n
